Market Analysis - Machine Learning

# Algorithm Description
- Using 5000 nodes in RandomForest Decision Trees to predict the return of a price of the stock over the next five years (UNDERPERFORM, ABOVE 100%, ABOVE 200%, ABOVE 300% and  ABOVE 400%)
- Using 6 input variables measuring earnings, debt, assets and industry. 


# Results
- Provided a ≈45% hit rate on the predicted return of all stocks in the S&P 500 between Aug 2016 - AUG 2021
- Predicted ≈75% of all underperforming  of companies in the S&P 500 between Aug 2016 - AUG 2021
- Ensured an 80%+ hit rate on Above 400% prediction to outperform the market (100%+ returns) between Aug 2016 - AUG 2021
- Assesed the financial standing of the S&P 500 components and created a list of stocks expected to underperform, and beat the market. Click here to see the excel sheet for the predictions.
