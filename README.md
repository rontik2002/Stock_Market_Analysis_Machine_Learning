Market Analysis - Machine Learning

# Algorithm Description
- Using 5000 nodes in RandomForest Decision Trees to predict the return of a price of the stock over the next five years (UNDERPERFORM, ABOVE 100%, ABOVE 200%, ABOVE 300% and  ABOVE 400%)
- Using 6 input variables measuring earnings, debt, assets and industry.
